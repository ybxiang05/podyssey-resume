      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi Melody and Danny, Thanks for taking the time to read my application. I thought about
        submitting a traditional resume like you asked, but I wanted to create an opportunity where
        I can show you the thoughts, values, and skills that make up who I am without the
        constraints of a tired and clich√©d form. More importantly, I wanted a chance to tell you my
        story. After all, half the intrigue of a good podcast is in its storytelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Language has always been one of my deepest obsessions. I'm endlessly fascinated by the ways
        in which words and the worlds we build with them can bring us together, drive us apart, and,
        in its unique paradoxical logic, elicit the very emotions in us that we'd experience
        differently if we didn't have the language to name them. This fascination resulted in my
        pursuit of an undergraduate degree in English Literature at the University of Toronto
        (2014), followed by a masters degree in English Language and Literatures at the University
        of British Columbia (2018). More importantly, it brought me to my love of podcasts.
      </p>
      <h3>Why I want to work for Podyssey</h3>
      <p>
        I want to work for Podyssey for a lot of different reasons, but many of them have to do with
        the pandemic. I voluntarily left a position as a junior developer with a Toronto-based
        startup in June amidst the chaos of the pandemic and the growing outrage as result of the
        systemic violences against BIPOC around the world. I wanted to give myself the time and
        space to reflect on my relationship to capitalism and white supremacy. I also wanted to
        reflect on how I can use my gift with words to help others connect in these strange times,
        and in doing so, reconnect with myself and my values.
      </p>

        been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
        galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
        passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
        versions of Lorem Ipsum.
