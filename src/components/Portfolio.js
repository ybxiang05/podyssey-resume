        Hi! Thanks for visiting my portfolio highlights. Below are some of my recent projects that I
        had the most fun building.
      </h5>
      <h2>Uncle Ray's Ultimate Quarantine Workout</h2>
      <img src={ray} alt="gif of Uncle Ray's Quanrantine Workout" />
      <p>
        Something that usually keeps me sane in this life is playing ultimate frisbee. I'm a
        competitive athlete in the Vancouver ultimate scene, and I played on a touring team called
        Mola Mola (yes, the sunfish).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of COVID-19 and the ensuing quarantine, the team is not able to get together to play
        the game, but we have a Zoom workout every week to keep up fitness and to have some safe
        social interaction. I got tired of having to refer back to Zoom chat for the next workout
        between exercises, and thus was born Uncle Ray's Ultimate Quarantine Workout (Uncle Ray is a
        stoic teammate who runs these workouts).{" "}

      <h2>VenMuse App</h2>

      <p>
        VenMuse is a group project I made with three other junior developers over the period of a
        week. I was a professional musician in a previous life. As such, I know that a vibrant local
        music scene is predicated on local artists being able to connect with local venues. We built
        the app as a platform for musicians to be able to connect with venues, so it's easier for
        both parties to book gigs. This app also removes the middle person, and ensures the
        musicians get a higher cut than if they were to use an agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        I liked this project a lot because I got to design all of the UX, as well as some of the UI.
        It also holds significance for me as a musician, who wants to help foster Vancouver's local
        music scene.

        Ah, R10. I still don't understand why this project is called R10; it's one of the standard
        projects in the RED Academy App Dev course.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is special to me because it was the first time I felt like I understand not
        only how to use React Native, but its full potential. Really, I think I just really like JSX
        and being able to use states and ternary statements (is that weird? There's something I find
        really satisfying about being using `useState` to turn components on and off like a
        lightswitch
        <span role="img" aria-label="sheepish smiley face">
          ðŸ˜…
        </span>
